# Auto-ML-regression-utility-hub
The AutoML regression utility hub project automates the process of building and optimizing machine learning models for regression tasks.
**AutoML Regression Utility Hub**
**Overview**
The AutoML Regression Utility Hub is a powerful tool designed to automate the process of building and optimizing machine learning models specifically for regression tasks. This project aims to simplify the workflow for users, enabling high-quality predictions with minimal manual intervention. By leveraging advanced techniques such as automated feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, it caters to both experts and non-experts in the field of machine learning.
**Features**
**Automated Feature Engineering**: Automatically selects and transforms relevant features from your dataset to improve model performance.
**Model Selection**: Evaluates multiple regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model for your data.
**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search to enhance prediction accuracy.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for easy interaction and configuration, making it accessible for users with varying levels of expertise.
**Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on model performance, including metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
